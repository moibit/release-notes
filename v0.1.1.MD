# Release notes (Moibit Version v0.1.1)

## Enhancements

1. Moibit users can now login to the developer dashboard and add, remove, pin and view files using a user interface. They can also play around with API endpoints, view API docs, view their API key and secret, the number of files they have added, storage used by them etc.
2. Users can now reset their password if they forget it.
3. All file addition endpoints (writefile, writetexttofile, writefiles), as well as filestatus and listfiles endpoints now show the pin status of the file in question and the time at which the file was added/updated.
4. There's enhanced file replication (all user files are now pinned across multiple nodes by default).
5. There's a new endpoint _stream_ to add larger files faster.
6. There's a new endpoint _writefiles_ to upload directories.
7. There's a new endpoint _makedir_ to create an empty directory.
8. There's a new endpoint _versions_ to view a list of available versions for any file.

## Optimization and Fixes

1. The _storageused_ endpoint now calculates the storage used by a user with much greater accuracy.
2. The _readfile_ endpoint is now optimized to use less RAM which allows concurrent reading of multiple large files.
3. The _remove_ endpoint now removes a file from the file tree and also unpins it - effectively removing it completely.
